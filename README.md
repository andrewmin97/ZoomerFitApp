# ZoomerFitApp
This app was designed to help users properly, and effectively perform at-home workouts. By providing users a database of workout regimen, as well as the power to upload their own workouts, this app appeals to those who want to be coached, as well as those who want to coach.

## Motivation
Due to COVID-19, gyms all over the world have been shut down and people have been forced to figure out their own methods of staying fit while stuck in their homes. Social media sites, such as Instagram, have been flooded with fitness influencers posting their own at-home workouts for their followers to perform. Though this is a good bandage solution to the current issue, there needs to be a more organized way for people to reach/maintain their fitness goals. This is why we want to create an app, acting as a database, where influencers can post their workouts and followers can find workouts tailored to their goals and fitness levels.
